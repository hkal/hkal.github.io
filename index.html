          <li class="description">
            I began my time at Viewpost on the web team where I led many initiatives such as: designing and implementing a build process for the frontend web client, a rewrite of the app's onboarding experience, and integration with Stripe and Plaid. In fall 2015, I joined a newly formed Mobile team to build an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/viewpost-invoice/id1049112141?mt=8">app</a> that enables users to easily send invoices and receive payments on the go.

            A majority of my time at Cloudspace was spent writing Ruby and Javascript apps for various clients. In between client work I was given time to work on pet projects like <a href="http://crunchinator.com">Crunchinator</a>.

            I started at StackFrame as an intern while pursuing a bachelor's degree in economics. In summer 2012, I was offered and accepted a fulltime position.

I also organized and ran a monthly lunch training to help share knowledge between engineers working on different projects.
